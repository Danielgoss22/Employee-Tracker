# Employee-Tracker

## Description

-I wanted to create an employee tracking database for a school in order for them to organize there pay and structure.

-While working through this challenge I ran into a few different problems, first was that i was forgeting that when creating tables I cannot skip values that need to be passed to each table when creating the seed data. Second, I was having a hard time figuring out the syntax that mysql was reqiring when adding or updating employee data which made me look into docs and work with tutors.

-I am grateful to the tutors I used, Juan Delgado and Andrew Hardemon, because they were helpful in putting me on the right path with connect my two index.js files. I kept trying to pass random arguments that were not matching up and both tutors were able to help show me where I was going wrong.
